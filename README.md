# üèóÔ∏è LangChain Agent API

## üìö Description

The **LangChain Agent API** is a robust and scalable backend solution crafted to streamline inventory management by utilizing the power of FastAPI and LangChain's AI capabilities. This API provides comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities for managing inventory items, along with AI agents that can handle various inventory-related tasks through natural language processing.

## ‚ú® Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Seamlessly add, view, update, and delete inventory items.
- **AI Integration**: Employ LangChain AI tools to manage inventory through intuitive natural language queries.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Enjoy fast and non-blocking operations harnessing the capabilities of FastAPI alongside SQLAlchemy Async.
- **Configuration Management**: Securely configure your environment using `dotenv`.
- **Modular Design**: A well-structured codebase that separates app layers and components for ease of maintenance and extension.

## üöÄ Installation

To set up and run the LangChain Agent API locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/langchain-agent-api.git
   cd langchain-agent-api
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up your environment variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the required variables:

   ```plaintext
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
   INVENTORY_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
   ```

5. **Run the application**:

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

Interact with the system through the available API endpoints:

- **Get all stocks**: `GET /stock/all`
- **Get stocks by category**: `GET /stock/categories/{category}`
- **Add a new stock item**: `POST /stock/add` with JSON payload
- **Delete a stock item by ID**: `DELETE /stock/delete/{stock_id}`

### üîç Example

To add a new stock item to the inventory, send a POST request to `/stock/add` with the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "category": "electronics",
  "item": "headphones",
  "quantity": 50
}
```

### ü§ñ AI Agent Query

Utilize the AI agent for natural language processing by sending a POST request to `/agent/query` with this JSON body:

```json
{
  "query": "Add 20 jeans to the clothes category"
}
```
